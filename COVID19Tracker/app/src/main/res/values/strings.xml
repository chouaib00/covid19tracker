    <string name="details">The first case of the new Coronavirus COVID-19 was recorded on 31 December in Wuhan,
                            China (WHO). Since then, more than 500,000 confirmed cases have been recorded worldwide.\n\nMost
                            people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate
                            respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people,
                            and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
                            respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</string>
